# 8x8-Bitmap-Image-Builder
The "8x8 Bitmap Image Builder", a program that I’m writing, is designed to help out with creating a bitmap file that’s 8 by 8 pixels big,
written originally for the RGB LED matrix that's on the Raspberry Pi Sense HAT. Thought it was a cool idea for a programming project.
It may even be useful for someone.

This software was written in Visual Studio Community 2019 on Windows. It will run on Linux using compatibility layers such as "Wine". It
may be possible to run this program on the Raspberry Pi itself. Just install MonoDevelop and the Mono libraries, run the program from the
Terminal (mono "path-to-program.exe"), and you should be good to go! Good luck!

The source code and compiled binary are available in this repo. I will build an application installer for this program once it becomes
fully ready. It will take a while.

Once this program is in full swing, I may upload a brief tutorial on how to use this program to my YouTube channel
(https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCq2dUyVKyvjOQHhRAtaKgxQ). Keep a lookout for that.
